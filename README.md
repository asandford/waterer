# watererer
# This will eventually be a system where up to 8 zones can be watered with multiple schedules
# Schedules can be defined by time (eg 08:00 for 3 minutes) or intervale (eg every 1 hour for 1 minute)
# Multiple schedules can be attached to a policy 
# Each zone can have a policy assined to it (there is no collision detection planned, so if multiple schedules overlap, the watering will be on)
